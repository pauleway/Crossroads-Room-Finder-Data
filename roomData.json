    "blurb": "Alan Turing was an English mathematician and pioneer in computer science. His visionary idea for a \"universal machine” that could recognize and perform instructions through computation is the forerunner of modern computers. Turing was fascinated by  the question of whether machines could think and laid the foundation for the field of artificial intelligence. During World War II, he worked for the British government decoding ciphers, including the Nazi’s \"Enigma” code, which helped the Allied Forces gain a critcal advantage over the German military. Despite his significant contributions to science and to his country, Turing was persecuted by the British government for being a gay man. In 2009, the British prime minister offered a posthumous apology for the terrible mistreatment Turing had endured.",
